# Form Validation and Test Fixes - May 18, 2025

## Current Status and Problems

We're working on fixing the QuoteWizard integration tests, specifically focusing on form validation behavior. The main issue is that the "Next" button's disabled state isn't properly reflecting the form's validation state.

### What's Been Done

1. Fixed test setup issues:
   - Removed invalid "npm run test" line from `setupTests.ts`
   - Updated button references to use `passengersFinalNextBtn` consistently

2. Improved test robustness:
   - Added explicit validation state checks
   - Implemented proper waiting for state updates
   - Added error message presence/absence verification
   - Increased timeouts to account for async validation

3. Identified core issues:
   - Button reference inconsistency in tests
   - Form validation state not properly propagating
   - Stale button references after step changes

### Current Problems

1. The test "shows error and disables Next for invalid Passengers" is still failing
   - Button remains disabled even with valid inputs
   - Possible issue with validation state propagation
   - May need to investigate `stepValidity` state updates in QuoteWizard

### Next Steps

1. Verify if the latest test changes fix the validation issues
2. If still failing:
   - Add debug logging for validation state changes
   - Review `stepValidity` state management in QuoteWizard
   - Check if form validation events are properly triggering

### Technical Context

- Testing Stack:
  - @testing-library/react for component testing
  - Zod with zodResolver for form validation
  - React Hook Form for form state management

- Validation Requirements:
  - At least one adult required
  - Children can be zero or more
  - Notes are optional
